# The CTO's Nearshore Playbook

Building and scaling a high-performance nearshore team is one of the most significant strategic advantages a modern technology company can unlock. It is also a process fraught with hidden complexities, operational pitfalls, and outdated vendor models.

This repository is an open-source, curated collection of resources, data, and templates designed for technical leaders (CTOs, CIOs, VPs of Engineering) who are serious about getting nearshore right.

This is not a sales document. It is a living playbook, maintained by the data science and engineering teams at **[TeamStation AI](https://teamstation.dev/)**. Our goal is to provide the ground-truth data and practical tools that are conspicuously absent from the traditional nearshore conversation.

### About This Project

This playbook is a reflection of our core belief: building elite teams should be an engineering discipline, not a gamble. The methodologies and data presented here are a high-level summary of the science that powers our **[Axiom Cortex™ cognitive AI engine](https://teamstation-ai.github.io/Axiom-Cortex-Methodology/)**.

While this playbook provides the tools, our **Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™** platform provides the fully-managed infrastructure. If you're ready to move from theory to execution, **[schedule a technical demo](https://teamstation.dev/home/executive-summary)**.
